							<h2>History</h2>
							<p> Swan Ping Pong Club was estalished by Haiping Zhao and Amy Zhong on Sept 2012. 
							From the begining, Swan aims to provide the best equipment, the best environment and the best location 
							to Ping Pong players. It soon attracted a large group of fan base. However, high rent 
							at the center of Silicon Valley is always a formidable obstacle to overcome .
							</p>
							
							<p> On Sept 2015, Haiping and Amy permenantly moved back to China, and the club temporarily closed
							for a month. Then, Mrs Jing Wang bravely took the task to be the professional manager of the club.
							While in the back, Haiping still provides a large subsidy for the rent, Mrs Wang has been working
							extremely hard for no pay to continue operating the club and get the rest of rent paid.
							</p>
							
							<h2> Future </h2>
							
							<p> Due to family issues, Mrs Wang is unable to manage the club after the end of April 2016. 
							The club faces the risk of closing again. </p>
							
							<p> We, a group of Ping Pong fans, are stepping up to prevent this from happening. We are establishing a 501(c)(3)
							public charity organization: <a href="http://pp-community.org">Ping Pong Community</a>, to continue managing 
							and operating the Swan club. </p>
							
							<p> Starting from Dec 2016, PPC will open Swan Club free to public. Having one of the best Ping Pong facility free to public 
							is like a dream come true. This is not an easy task. We need volunteers and donations. Your help will be greatly appreciated. </p>
