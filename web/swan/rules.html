											in 20 minutes. One of them, by default, the defeated, need to
											give up the table to the waiting player.
									</ul></li>
								<li>Multi-ball play is generally not allowed. Swan playing
									fields are relatively small and not enclosed. Using multi-ball,
									even just two balls, can affect players at neighboring tables.
									<ul>
										<li>Exception: when club is not busy, you may use
											barriers to set up an enclosed area, and practice multi-balls
											within it. You can use club balls in this case. Please pick
											up all club balls and return them to the original place after

							<h2>Swan Codes of Ethic</h2>

							<p>Codes of Ethic are for building a friendly and homey
								environment at Swan. Some of them are due to the relatively
								smaller playing fields at Swan Club.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Welcome and play with new players.
								<li>Pick up balls for others. When a ball rolls into your
									field, pick it up and throw it back. This can save other
									players the time and effort to go across the fields to get the
									ball, which may distract your play.
								<li>Wait for a rally to finish before go across fields to
									get your ball back. You can also signal to the players so that
									they can return the ball to you.
								<li>Give let to your opponent when balls or players from
									other tables affect your table.
								<li>Give a hand to Swan volunteer staffs when they are
									cleaning up the club.
								<li>Put garbage into garbage can, do not throw them into
									recycle bin.
								<li>Apologize when run into others during play.
								<li>Honor other playersâ€™ requests to exchange tables to use
									tables with larger fields if their play needs more
									space, i.e., for playing double, or playing chopping and
									fishing styles.
