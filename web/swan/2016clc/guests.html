							<h2>
								<span>Guest Team Rules</span>
							</h2>

							<p>We are excited to see this yearâ€™s CLC draw extensive
								enthusiasm from all kinds of ping pong players. Our mission is
								to build a high level team competition platform with company
								teams as the main participants. At the same time, we would also
								like to provide an opportunity for more players to participate,
								have fun, learn from each others and make friends. Therefore, we
								decided to allow guest teams to participate in this CLC. Guest
								teams are for players who cannot participate in the regular CLC
								teams, including professional players, professional coaches,
								students, kids and youths. Following are the rules for guest
								teams.</p>

							<p>Guest teams will play the same big round robin with
								regular teams. Guest teams do not participate in the regular CLC
								playoff round. Guest teams that are ranked among the top 8 in
								the Big RR phase, if more than one, will play a guest team
								playoff round. The game format will be round robin. The prize is
								$300 for the champion and $100 for the runner upper.</p>

							<p>If there is a guest champion, there will be a bonus
								championship game between the guest champion and the CLC
								champion. The winner will get an additional $200 prize. If there
								is no guest champion, the top guest team in the Big RR round, if
								ranked in the top 8, can play the bonus championship game with
								the CLC champion to compete for the bonus championship title and
								the $200 prize.</p>
