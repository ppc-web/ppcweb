						<h3>Swan League 3-way tie breaker rules:</h3> In Swan table tennis tournaments or Sunday Leagues, a three-way tie in a round-robin format is resolved by comparing the records of the tied players within the group of tied players, first by game ratios. If those don't break the tie, other methods are used, such as comparing USATT Ranking when signed up for the game or even drawing lots. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
<ol>
<li>Game Ratio (Within the Tied Group):<br>
The first step is to examine the results of matches played only between the tied players by comparing the ratios of games won to games lost.
For example, if Player A won 6 games and lost 4, and Player B won 5 and lost 5, Player A would have a higher ratio. 
</li><br>
<li>Head-to-Head Record (Within the Tied Group):<br>
If the Game Ratio record doesn't resolve the tie, the next step is to compare Head-to-Head Record.
For example, if Player A beat Player B, and Player B beat Player C, and Player C beat Player A, then the next tiebreaker would be needed. 
</li><br>
<li>USATT Ranking:<br>
If Head-to-Head Record cannot resolve the tie, the player with the lowest USATT Ranking will break the tie and is considered winner within the group and allowed to be promoted in the next league group assignment.
</li><br>
<li>Other Methods:<br>
Drawing of lots: If all else fails, a random method like drawing names or flipping a coin will be administered by Swan League Committee at the appropriate time (same day or through email or next league time)<br>
</li><br>
</ol>
